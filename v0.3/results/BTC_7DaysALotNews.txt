Each entry includes the article's information, the Bitcoin prices at different times, and an estimated influence percentage. However, the influence values are all negative, implying that these news articles had no positive impact on Bitcoin's price.

1) OKX, a cryptocurrency exchange, closed its Bitcoin mining pool, which led to a slight drop in Bitcoin's price.
2) Argo Blockchain, a mining company, saw an increase in short interest, which didn't seem to have a significant impact on Bitcoin's price.
3) An article suggested avoiding trading four cryptocurrencies, which may have led to some investors becoming cautious and impacting the Bitcoin price slightly.
4) Bitcoin price rose by 4%, which might have been due to its intrinsic factors and not external news influences.
5) Large drawdowns in cryptocurrencies like Doge, Solana, and Bitcoin were mentioned, which could have made investors apprehensive.
6) The UK Supreme Court rejected Craig Wright's appeal in a libel case, this might have had a minor influence on Bitcoin's price as it relates to its creator.
7) Jeffrey Gundlach's statement about considering cash and gold over Bitcoin might have discouraged some Bitcoin investors.
8) The contribution of GBTC to Bitcoin's downfall was discussed, which might have led to a negative sentiment in the market.
9) The US announced the sale of around $117 million worth of Bitcoin, which could have influenced its price.

In summary, most news articles seem to have had a negative influence on Bitcoin's price. The price increase over the last week could be due to market dynamics and not just these news articles.
