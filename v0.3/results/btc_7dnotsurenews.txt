1. The cryptocurrency exchange OKX announced the closure of its Bitcoin mining pool, which could have caused a slight worry among investors.
However, this news had a negative influence score of -2.8755, suggesting it might have led to a slight decrease in the Bitcoin price.
2. The article about Argo Blockchain plc experiencing a large increase in short interest might have sparked interest in the cryptocurrency market, but it also had a negative influence score.
3. The news about the cryptocurrency market recovering after two weeks of poor performance following the Bitcoin spot ETF approval might have encouraged investors, leading to a slight price increase.
4. News about Bitcoin's price rising by 4% in the past 24 hours could have also contributed to the overall price increase.
5. Another potential influence is the report about the U.K. Supreme Court rejecting Craig Wright’s request to appeal a decision in his legal dispute with popular Bitcoin podcaster Peter McCormack. This might have created some uncertainty among investors.
6. Lastly, the announcement of the U.S. planning to sell around $117 million worth of Bitcoin could have affected the price.

However, it is important to note that these news events could have both positive and negative effects on the Bitcoin price.
Moreover, other factors such as market trends, investor sentiment, and global economic conditions could also influence the price.

Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters New York CNN — Bitcoin is rocketing higher, topping $35,000 for the first time since May 2022. It's up 20% over the past five days.
NEW YORK (AP) — Bitcoin is once again having a moment. On Monday, the world's largest cryptocurrency soared past $41,000 for the first time in over a year and a half — and marking a 150% rise so far this year. Bitcoin (BTC) price surged to $44,000 on some crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, for the first time since early April 2022 as the largest crypto extended its rally supported by declining interest rates and anticipation for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S. The rally is supported by a confluence of growing institutional investor interest and anticipation of an imminent regulatory approval for listing spot-based BTC ETFs in the U.S., according to LMAX Group market strategist Joel Kruger. Updated Jan 24, 2024 at 1:45 a.m. UTC. Bitcoin (BTC) dropped 7.5% Monday morning, its steepest intraday drop since mid-August. Bitcoin is still up over 150% this year, though the massive, sudden ...The search results confirm the news observed in the dataset. Bitcoin's price has indeed seen a significant increase over the past few days, reaching its highest point since April 2022. This increase could be attributed to several factors, including growing institutional investor interest, anticipation for an imminent regulatory approval for listing spot-based BTC ETFs in the U.S., and the decline in interest rates. However, it also experienced a 7.5% drop on Monday morning, its steepest intraday drop since mid-August. Despite this drop, Bitcoin is still up over 150% this year. Therefore, it can be concluded that the price change of Bitcoin in the past 7 days is due to a combination of these factors.

Final Answer: Over the past 7 days, the Bitcoin price has increased from 41608.04 to 41821.46.
This increase could be attributed to several factors such as growing institutional investor interest,
anticipation for an imminent regulatory approval for listing spot-based BTC ETFs in the U.S., and the decline in interest rates.
However, Bitcoin also experienced a significant drop on one of the days, which could have been influenced by various news such as the closure of
OKX's Bitcoin mining pool and the legal dispute involving Craig Wright. Despite this drop, Bitcoin is still up over 150% this year, suggesting a strong overall performance.
